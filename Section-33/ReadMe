Postgres Server and pgAdmin - https://sbp.enterprisedb.com/getfile.jsp?fileid=1258653

The Postgres Server is the actual software or database. The pgAdmin is the UI to communicate with this Server. 

We need to import a package called pg, which will help us to connect our backend to Postgres. 

When we are creating a table, we specify a field as a primary key. The primary key essentially means that the values of this field is unique to every entry.
