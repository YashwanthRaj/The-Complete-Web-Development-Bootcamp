# Section 25 - Embedded Javascript

Embedding javascript into html. We need to use a templating language is for embedding javascript into html. Thats where EJS comes in. EJS is like a little javascript module which can run javascript inside a html file. The format of embedded javascript is .ejs and is html with pieces of javascript in it with a special syntax. 

## EJS Tags

**JS Output**

<%=       %>    // Contents of this tag is a javascript code which will have an output [variable names]

**JS Execute**

<%          %>   // Contents of this tag will executable javascript code which will not have an output that can be attached to the html. 

**Render HTML**

<%-          %>   // Contents of this tag should be interpreted as html code. 

**Escape EJS tag [show <% or %>]**

<% %        % %>    // Show the % sign 

**EJS Comments**

<%#          %>      // Comments

**Insert another EJS**

<%- include(”header.js”) %>    // Another EJS File

In every project, the public folder denote the static files. We then specify the location of the static files in our program, this will make the href locations relevant to the specified public folder.

## Partials

Instead of repeating parts of code, we can just include other content from other file,
