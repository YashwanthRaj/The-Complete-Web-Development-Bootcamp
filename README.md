### How does internet work?

Internet can be visualized as a piece of wire that connects computers all over the world. Some computers are specialized to be available 24*7 and serve you data. These computers are called servers. The computers that we use to access the data are called client. 

When we make a request in the client side system, say in a browser, then the request goes through the ISP (Internet Service Provider) to a DNS (Domain Name System). The DNS will look through database and return the IP of the webpage that we are looking for. Now once we get the IP for the destination webpage, we will make a direct request to the IP address which will return us the page. 

Every Computer connected to the internet has an IP address. Its unique and with this IP address is how we will locate a computer in internet. 

### How do websites work ?

The websites are comprised of three types of files:

HTML - These are the contents of a website

CSS - For styling the content

JS -  For adding functionality 

When a website is loaded in the browser, it will pull these files form the server.
