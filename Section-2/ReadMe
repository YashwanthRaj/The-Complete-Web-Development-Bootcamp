# Section 2 - Introduction to HTML

### What is HTML ?

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML comprise of the contents that are shown in a website. In general, CSS and JS cannot alone comprise a website. But CSS alone can be a website. 

### Heading Element

These represent the heading contents in a website. General syntax for tags - 

<h1> Contents </h1>

Here the h1 represent the tag name and the the closing tag will have / inside it. 

Tags refer to the content inside the angle braces. Eg. <h1> </h1>

Elements refer to the entire line with tag and content. Eg. <h1> Contents </h1>

The h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6 represent the level of headings.

### Paragraph Element

Similar to the heading element, it represents the paragraph. Syntax - 

<p> Content </p>

### Void Element

In these elements we cannot put anything inside the tag. Ex - <hr />, <br />

The **hr** represents a horizontal rule element which will add a line in the position it is placed. It does not need any contents for it to work. 

Similarly the **br** represents a line break in between contents of a same paragraphs. It is recommended to use break element when we need to have things in separate lines rather than using it to separate paragraphs. 

In these void elements, sometimes the ending /> , people will remove the / and just write <hr> etc. Its perfectly fine
